<h1>Elasticsearch 7.6 Multiple Join with Nest
</h1>
<p>I had to use the multiple Join for a project that I was working on in the past days. I looked for the muti join example on the internet but couldnâ€™t find anything even in the official documentation. Finally, I wrote it myself in some way and decided to write this article so that you could use it. Have Fun!</p>
